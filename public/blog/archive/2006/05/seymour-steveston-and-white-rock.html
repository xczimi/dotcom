            For saturday i accepted Kim's invitation to see some places of interest i missed last year. Mount Seymour, Steveston és White Rock in the order of visit. The sky - despite Geoff reported sunshine for the whole day - wasn't cleared by the morning, so we started our trip in a awful weather in her white sports car. It was rainging heavily. This shouldn't have been a problem to look down from Mount Seymour, but the cloud level was below the mouuntain so we didn't seen anything but fog. After this, we decided to give the weather (and Geoff) an other chance and headed south. <a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="/blog/images/IMG-0082-3c44f4996f6d-orig.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="/blog/images/IMG-0082-3c44f4996f6d.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br />At the turn of the twentieth century, Steveston was the busiest fishing port in the world, with fifteen salmon canneries, six hotels, numerous saloons and gambling dens, and up to fourteen windjammers simultaneously loading canned salmon for world markets. In the heart of old Steveston Village is the Steveston Museum.  <a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="/blog/images/IMG-0093-41a088f4f2f7-orig.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="/blog/images/IMG-0093-41a088f4f2f7.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> The place has nice houses and a dock, the whalewatching boats are starting from here as well.  <a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="/blog/images/IMG-0079-2cacdbeecda0-orig.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="/blog/images/IMG-0079-2cacdbeecda0.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> The museum presented the historical devices fairly authentic way, so i got a small wild-western walking around the small rooms :) We celebrated the lighter shower with a short walk, and got into a souvenir shop as well. <br />After leaving Stevenstone, we arrived to White Rock, and we got into a restaurant escaping from the rain. White Rock is a "holiday village" just next to the US border. It cleared a bit after lunch so we got to the pier. <a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="/blog/images/IMG-0098-b065b1f92e16-orig.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="/blog/images/IMG-0098-b065b1f92e16.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Getting back to the coast we got into a small house meant to be a museum, but it had only a small room showing a telegraph-station:<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="/blog/images/IMG-0105-2b95c5c358f6-orig.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="/blog/images/IMG-0105-2b95c5c358f6.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br />On the way home we entered the casino (this was the B-plan for the rain) - this was my first time in such a place, so with virgin-hands i didn't spend 25 bucks, rather left them with a 140CAD winning... good DEAL!
