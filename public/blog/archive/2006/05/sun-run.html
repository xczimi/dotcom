            Sunday 0700 AM. I wake up. Geting out from the bed! That happened only because the Sun Run is going to happen on this shiny sunday morning. The Sun Run is the sport event which makes the most people to do something really healthy. (I am afraid the Canucks games are getting more citizens excited, but especially not in these days... ) <a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7433/817/1600/IMG_0044.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7433/817/320/IMG_0044.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> This year with record-beating 50746 registered runners, i took part in canadas biggest 10K run. Letting 50K people run in the same time in the same direction was successfully driven my Turkish troops in 1526 (yes, the hungarian "army" was running away) , but so far the world is more civilised (especially this corner) so we crossed the start-line in 2-3K batches, letting the faster runners first. I was waiting in a middle-rated group (white numbers) so 53 minutes after the start-shoot i crossed the start and was registered via my chip fastened to my shoe. By this time, the first fastest guy from Kenya had been waiting for the medal ceremony with a time 28:15 ... After passing the first kilometer, i stopped for taking photos several times, especially when i passed the bands playing along the route. Here are two of these bands <a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7433/817/1600/IMG_0057.0.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7433/817/320/IMG_0057.0.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7433/817/1600/IMG_0056.0.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7433/817/320/IMG_0056.0.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br />My result was around 66 minutes, which is not that bad taking into account that i biked 70K on saturday and missed a lot of training in the past 6 months...
